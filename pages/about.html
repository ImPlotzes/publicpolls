        <h1>About PublicPolls</h1>

        <h2>What is PublicPolls?</h2>
        <p>
            PublicPolls is a site where anyone can create a poll. This poll will
            be immediately available to anyone. The most recently created polls
            are shown on the home page. You don't need an account to create a
            poll or vote on one. You do however need to fill in a when you
            create a poll. This name doesn't have to be your real name. This
            is just to help other people find your poll.
        </p>

        <h2>Why was this made?</h2>
        <p>
            This site was made for the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-our-spring-developer-challenge/">Cloudflare Spring Developer Challenge 2022</a>.
            The goal of the challenge was to make something with the theme 
            "real-time" and "collaborative". You also had to use at least two of
            Cloudflare's developer products. The products that would count were
            Workers, Cloudflare Pages, Durable Objects or Workers KV.
        </p>
        <p>
            For PublicPolls I used Cloudflare Pages to host the front-end. With
            the help of Pages Functions I rewrite the HTML for the home page and
            poll pages. R2, Cloudflare's new beta product, is used to store poll
            the poll data. I used Workers to access R2 and make an API. Pages
            Functions uses this API to get the poll data and then rewrite the HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea for PublicPolls didn't come instantly. I asked people for
            ideas and quite a lot were pretty fun, but since I use Cloudflare's
            free plan, I don't have access to Durable Objects. Most ideas
            would rely on Durable Objects. Eventually the idea came after someone
            said "Or a site where users can put up polls with voting options and
            vote on the polls of others". I really liked this so I didn't change
            anything about the idea and started creating it.
        </p>

        <h2>How are votes counted?</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever you vote on a poll the hash of your IP address is stored
            as the vote. A hash is a unique string of text derived from your
            IP address. This hash cannot be reversed to get your IP address.
            This hash is all that's stored as your vote. The hash of any votes
            are never given to any other user. Each user can only see how 
            many votes a certain option has.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the only identifier of a user is their IP address, it might
            be possible for a user to vote multiple times on the same poll.
            This is why you should not rely on this service as a 100% accurate
            polling service. This is mostly for fun and as a quick utility.
        </p>
